> This is a JavaScript module that can be used to easily include [OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/) code in a website or app in practically any JS front-end codebase (not limited to React).

* üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/OneSignal/react-onesignal#readme)
* üñ§ [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-onesignal)

OneSignal is the world's leader for Mobile Push Notifications, Web Push, and In-App Messaging. It is trusted by 2 million+ businesses to send 9 billion Push Notifications per day.

You can find more information on OneSignal [here](https://onesignal.com/).

## Install

You can use `yarn` or `npm`.

### Yarn

```bash
yarn add react-onesignal
```

### npm

```bash
npm install --save react-onesignal
```

---
## Usage

Initialize OneSignal with your `appId` via the `options` parameter:

```js
import OneSignal from 'react-onesignal';

OneSignal.init({ appId: 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx' });
```

The `init` function returns a promise that resolves when OneSignal is loaded.

**Examples**
```js
await OneSignal.init({ appId: 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx' });
// do other stuff
```
---

```js
const [initialized, setInitialized] = useState(false);
OneSignal.init({ appId: 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx' }).then(() => {
  setInitialized(true);
  OneSignal.Slidedown.promptPush();
  // do other stuff
})
```

### Init Options
You can pass other [options](https://documentation.onesignal.com/v11.0/docs/web-sdk#initializing-the-sdk) to the `init` function. Use these options to configure personalized prompt options, auto-resubscribe, and more.

**Service Worker Params**
You can customize the location and filenames of service worker assets. You are also able to specify the specific scope that your service worker should control. You can read more [here](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/onesignal-service-worker-faq#sdk-parameter-reference-for-service-workers).

In this distribution, you can specify the parameters via the following:

| Field                      | Details                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `serviceWorkerParam`       | Use to specify the scope, or the path the service worker has control of.  Example:  `{ scope: "/js/push/onesignal/" }` |
| `serviceWorkerPath`        | The path to the service worker file.                                                                                   |

</details>

### Service Worker File
If you haven't done so already, you will need to add the [OneSignal Service Worker file](https://github.com/OneSignal/OneSignal-Website-SDK/files/7585231/OneSignal-Web-SDK-HTTPS-Integration-Files.zip) to your site ([learn more](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/web-push-quickstart#step-6-upload-files)).

The OneSignal SDK file must be publicly accessible. You can put them in your top-level root or a subdirectory. However, if you are placing the file not on top-level root make sure to specify the path via the service worker params in the init options (see section above).

**Tip:**
Visit `https://yoursite.com/OneSignalSDKWorker.js` in the address bar to make sure the files are being served successfully.

---
### Typescript
This package includes Typescript support.

```ts
interface IOneSignalOneSignal {
	Slidedown: IOneSignalSlidedown;
	Notifications: IOneSignalNotifications;
	Session: IOneSignalSession;
	User: IOneSignalUser;
	Debug: IOneSignalDebug;
	login(externalId: string, jwtToken?: string): Promise<void>;
	logout(): Promise<void>;
	init(options: IInitObject): Promise<void>;
	setConsentGiven(consent: boolean): Promise<void>;
	setConsentRequired(requiresConsent: boolean): Promise<void>;
}
```

### OneSignal API
See the official [OneSignal WebSDK reference](https://documentation.onesignal.com/v11.0/docs/web-sdk) for information on all available SDK functions.

---
## Advanced Usage
### Events and Event Listeners
Use listeners to react to OneSignal-related events:

### Notifications Namespace
| Event Name | Callback Argument Type |
|-|-|
|'click'      | NotificationClickEvent|
|'foregroundWillDisplay'| NotificationForegroundWillDisplayEvent
| 'dismiss'| NotificationDismissEvent|
|'permissionChange'| boolean|
|'permissionPromptDisplay'| void|

### Slidedown Namespace
| Event Name | Callback Argument Type |
|-|-|
|'slidedownShown'      | boolean |

### Push Subscription Namespace
| Event Name | Callback Argument Type |
|-|-|
|'change'      | boolean |

**Example**
```js
OneSignal.Notifications.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  console.log("The notification was clicked!", event);
});
```

See the [OneSignal WebSDK Reference](https://documentation.onesignal.com/v11.0/docs/web-sdk) for all available event listeners.

## Troubleshooting
### `window.OneSignal already defined as 'object'!`
You will get this error if you initialize twice. Make sure you are only initializing one time. When wrapped with `React.StrictMode`, your app might be rendering twice.

## Example App
This repo includes an `example` React application implementing OneSignal. It was created using `create-react-app`. The app uses this repository's root level directory as the `react-onesignal` package and will bundle any changes on every run.
